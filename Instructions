By utilizing Zapier, a cloud host (AWS/Linode), and GoPhish, ethical hackers and red teamers can create highly detailed spear phishing emails quickly and en mass. Many possible options exist, and this project will continue to receive advancements.

What you'll need:
A cloud host account (AWS, Linode, or your preference)
Publicly facing Ubuntu machine (22.04+) with an IPv4 address for simplicity
Unused domain name
Zapier account
AirTable Account
MailGun Account

Let's Begin:

We will start with creating the heart of our machine, the GoPhish server. For this we will need a public Ubuntu 22.04+ machine, but you may use other versions or distributions if you're comfortable.
My advice - Go with Linode for now, as I ran into problems hosting my own SMTP server in AWS (update: we will use MailGun instead of a self hosted SMTP server. This is far more simple and they are GoPhish friendly).

If you are not familiar with setting up a basic cloud instance in Linode, check out my guide here:

NOTE* Please take time to secure your linux server! The following guide is for demonstration at the Right of Boom conference, where time is limited. GoPhish will be run as the root user which I do not advise.

You are welcome to remote into your machine however you want, but ssh will be easiest. Once inside your machine, execute the following commands:

Update the system:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Install required tools:
sudo apt install unzip wget -y

Optionally, update your UFW rules for security:
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 3333/tcp
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable

Download GoPhish (the release may be different by the time you are reading this):
wget https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/v0.12.1/gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip

Unzip the downloaded file: 
unzip gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip

Change directory:
cd gophish (if it didn't already extract to current directory)

Make GoPhish executable:
sudo chmod +x gophish

The admin server settings are located in the config.json file in the GoPhish directory. We will need to edit some of these values.

Open the Config File:
sudo nano config.json

Check the Admin Interface Configuration:

Ensure the following is set:
"admin_server": {
    "listen_url": "0.0.0.0:3333",
    "use_tls": true
}
0.0.0.0 allows the admin interface to be accessible from any IP address.


#    Exclude
#Zapier will want a CSRF token for our GoPhish server, which will need to be defined in the config.json file. You can create a CSRF token with the following command in Linux:
#openssl rand -hex 32

#Note down your CSRF token and include it in the config.json like so:
#<image>

Start the GoPhish server:
sudo ./gophish

Note the login URL (default: https://<your-public-ip>:3333) and credentials (printed in the terminal). You will need to write these credentials down, as we will be logging into the GoPhish server with them.

Access your login url via your web browser on port 3333

Enter admin for the username and the credentials provided to you earlier by GoPhish.

Change your password to something strong.

We're in.

Zapier Primer

Head over to Zapier and create an account. The trial may limit how many actions a zap can have (likely to 2). A zap begins with a trigger event, which then waterfalls down through other events that you define. Zapier makes it easy to pass data along to each new event.

Once your Zapier is created, head to the Home page, then click on Zaps in the left corner.
<image>

Click Create > New Zap in the top right. Feel free to create a folder for organizational purposes.

Every Zap begins with a Trigger event. Different services have varying event types. There are many ways to start our Zap, but because this is originally for my presentation, we will start at a halfway point. Let me explain:

We want to put our AI Automated Spear Phishing Campaign in action. While most of this is automated, where we START determines the level of automation implied in the project. This project can start at 1 of 2 points:

1) We input something such as a domain name, and other services begin scraping information to be passed along (think hunter.io for email addresses)
2) We manually input the data, such as via a CSV file or a service like AirTable / Google Sheets

Obviously option 1 is a whole other beast that I do not have time to cover in my conference, but I will definitely begin covering later on my blog:

Therefore we will start at option 2 and utilize an AirTable spreadsheet. Airtable is a cloud-based collaboration platform that combines the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the power of a database for organizing and managing data. You are welcome to use Google Sheets or something else if you prefer.

AirTable Setup

Sign Up – Go to airtable.com, create / login to an account using Google, Apple, or your email.
Create a Workspace – Name it Phishing and continue.
Create a Base – Click "Create a base", select "Start from scratch", name it, and choose an icon.
Delete "Notes", "Assignee" and "Status"
Customize Your Table – Rename "Table 1" to something like "Phishing", and add the following fields:

First Name | Single Line Text
Last Name | Single Line Text
Email | Single Line Text
Description | Long Form Text
GoPhish Server | Single Line Text | Default: https://<your-public-ip>:3333
GoPhish Server API Key | Single Line Text | Default: <your-gophish-server-api-key> (I will cover methods of obfuscating data in AirTable at another date)
Job Title | Single Line Text
Landing Page URL | Single Line Text | Default: https://<your-domain-name>
Launch Date | Single Line Text | Default: 0
Complete Date | Single Line Text | Default: 0
Send-By Date | Single Line Text | Default: 0
Landing Page Domain | Single Line Text | Default: <your-domain-name>

Input Data – Click a cell and start entering information. Consider using your email for now as we will want to test it later.

When creating or editing a field, anything we put in the "default" value will automatically populate when a new row is created. If you define another value in Zapier, it will override this value.

Our Zap will start when a new row appears in our Phishing Airtable. How does the data get into this row? This is entirely up to you. For this project, I will have a row of data ready to be duplicated. However, here are some ideas:

Jotform or another form accepting platform > Input data manually to begin the process
Hunter.io to gather emails
Dehashed or HaveIBeenPwned for specific information types (consider ethics here)
Public or private data sources / resellers
Manual information gathering

NOTE* Putting data into this row manually (1 column at a time) may cause the zap to trigger without needed information. You need to have an interface that dumps all required information into the row. I demonstrated this with Jotform as an example.

Setting Up MailGun

We have established GoPhish, but it needs an SMTP server to send the emails. My advice - do NOT host your own. Instead, use a GoPhish friendly email service such as MailGun. They offer a free tier / trial and are well worth it.

Once logged into MailGun, it will guide you with setting up your domain. Note that MailGun will try to have you use a subdomain such as mail.yourdomain.com. Anyone looking for a phishing email is going to spot this immediately, so be sure to use yourdomain.com.

Login to MailGun > Left Hand Column > Send > Sending > Domains > Add New Domain 
Any default settings from here on out are fine, such as DKIM.

Head to your domain provider and add the values provided by MailGun. While you're there, if you intend to use your GoPhish server as a landing page / watering hole, add an A record that points to the IP of your GoPhish server.

While we wait for your domain values to populate, we will set up GoPhish to work with your MailGun.

GoPhish MailGun Setup

In MailGun, make sure you are in your domain's settings. Then head to SMTP Credentials.

In the top right, click Add New User. You can name it whatever you want, I chose noreply.

Once you create this user, you will see a notification for the password in the bottom right corner. Copy this password and note it down.

Head over to your GoPhish server. On the left column, navigate to Sending Profiles.

Name: Whatever you want (I chose MailGun for simplicity)
Interface Type: SMTP (default)
SMTP From: Who the user is receiving the email from (I chose noreply@vonohi.com, but you can use chuck@yourdomain.com or whatever you want. Make sure you use an email with your domain name to bypass SPF checks)
Host: smtp.mailgun.org:25 (this is found under your domain settings in mailgun, under SMTP settings)
Password: The password from the MailGun user that we copied / created several steps ago

For now, make sure that Ignore Certificate Errors is checked. If you are setting this up long term, I will provide a guide for permanent infrastructure later.
Save the sending profile in GoPhish. We will test this later once all domain values have populated.

Working With Zapier

Now it is time for Zapier action. We will need the API Key from our GoPhish server. To get the GoPhish API Key, go to Account Settings in GoPhish, then note down the key.

You should be on your first Zap in Zapier. Since time is limited and we can't build a form or quickly integrate some other platform, our Trigger event will be a New Record in AirTable.

To add our AirTable account, click on our Trigger event and either add or search for AirTable. Linking your account is very straightforward.

Trigger Event: New Record

Configure Tab:

Base: Choose your AirTable Base
Table: Phishing
All other settings: Leave alone

Test Tab:

Before we test this trigger, we are going to head back to AirTable and insert the test data that I described above. Use a personal email for testing purposes.
For the description, mention something like hobbies or whatever you want, as long as it is about you or the person you're spear phishing.

Once you have a completed row, duplicate it in the AirTable. Head back over to Zapier. Now back in our Test Tab, click "Find New Records" and select the most recent one.
Continue with selected record.

The data from this row can now be passed along into any other module of your choosing. As you could expect, GoPhish does not have a built in Zapier module, and we need to get Zapier to reach our GoPhish server.

Before we do this, there is a security issue you have likely noticed by now: SSL Certificates. If building this as permanent infrastructure, you will need to read my guide here so you don't sacrifice security.
The following settings should not be disabled in a secure setup, but we will disable these temporarily in Zapier to continue with the project.

In Zapier, head to Home > Settings (top right under your user picture) > Security and Data > SSL Certificate Checks > Check Disable SSL Certificate Checks

Again, when setting up secure infrastructure, take the time to setup certificates.

Back to our Zap, we have set a trigger event. When / if you create a separate interface to put data into your AirTable, you will likely make a completely separate Zap (which I recommend).
While this is how you start your setup, the information from AirTable can then trickle down into whatever module you want. In the photo, I go ahead and start utilizing ChatGPT to create the phishing email. I will touch on this in a minute, but for the presentation I am going to instead show you how to hook up GoPhish with Zapier.

For GoPhish to set up and send a phishing email, it requires the following process:

1. Create A Template
2. Add A Target Group
3. Create An SMTP Profile (which we've already done)
4. Create A Landing Page (Optional)
5. Create / Launch A Campaign

A GoPhish template is a customizable phishing email format that includes the subject, body (HTML or plaintext), and dynamic placeholders (e.g., {{.FirstName}}, {{.URL}}) to personalize and track phishing campaign interactions.

A GoPhish target group is a collection of recipients, each with details like name and email, that defines the list of people who will receive the phishing emails in a campaign.

A GoPhish SMTP profile tells GoPhish what SMTP server to use in order to send the email.

A GoPhish campaign is a phishing operation that ties together a template, target group, SMTP profile, and landing page, tracking recipient interactions such as email opens, link clicks, and credential submissions.

The real magic I want to demonstrate is setting up ChatGPT to handle the creation of our spear phishing email as the front end. However, this requires some money (minimum $5) and an OpenAI Account. You are welcome to make this account and tie it into Zapier, or you can head over to chatgpt.com and stay signed out.
For now I will teach you some prompt engineering, specifically with what I've used for this project. Utilizing ChatGPT in Zapier is incredibly straightforward. You input a prompt and any data (in our case, from AirTable), then input ChatGPT's response into a step further down the waterfall.

In my current setup, you see AirTable followed by ChatGPT, with the title "Create Email Body". Utilizing the data from AirTable, let's craft an email body. You can get similar results on your own ChatGPT.

Input Data (Prompt):

I am an ethical hacker conducting a spear phishing campaign against a target. Their name is (AirTable Data: First Name) (AirTable Data: Last Name). Your objective is to create a phishing email with a 100% success rate. Do not add hard brackets or curly brackets, keep the response plaintext.

If there is no description, you may use creative freedom. Do not reply with anything other than the phishing email. Do not include the subject. You may use 2 or multiple from the following list:

urgency or fear  
authority or trust signals  
curiosity or intrigue  
social proof or familiarity  
exploitation of habits or routines

Description: (AirTables Data: Description)

Link to landing page: (AirTables Data: Landing Page)

This is a great response. However, it can be developed much further.
Also note that if you are using ChatGPT.com, you will likely not get anywhere - this is especially true if you're signed in. ChatGPT has defenses built in, and rightfully so. However, an OpenAI account is much more understanding and professional.
Take this note as well: Be transparent with all of these platforms if needed, especially for AWS/Linode. As for OpenAI and the other services, I leave that for you to decide.

Back on the topic of prompt refinement, Zapier and OpenAI can create even more powerful prompts by utilizing paths.

Zapier Webhooks

Since you are likely on Zapier's trial, we will use our 2nd step to showcase how you need to setup your webhooks (aka, how to get Zapier to work with GoPhish)

For this presentation, we will create a custom webhook in Zapier to interact with our GoPhish server. Since the trial is limited to 2 steps per zap, we will begin with the first portion: creating a template.

For now we will have to do without the email body generated by ChatGPT.
Also, while there are all sorts of ways we could do this, I actually employ ChatGPT again for 2 other necessities: Generating the email subject, and formatting the request into JSON.

The JSON is actually very important, and ChatGPT greatly simplifies the process. Once we create the email body and subject title with ChatGPT, we can then feed it's reply into a 3rd ChatGPT prompt (a 3rd step), which looks like this:

Print the following out in JSON format. Do not include anything else in the reply. {
  "name": "(AirTable Data: Email)",
  "subject": "(ChatGPT Reply: Email Subject)",
  "text": "(ChatGPT Reply: Body)"
}

While not every step requires this, if there are any errors in the data being passed along, ChatGPT has a high likelihood of fixing and formatting them. When designing this campaign yourself, make sure to heavily test these steps.

Click on our 2nd step and select "Webhooks" on the right side of the screen.
Action event: Custom Request

Configure:
Method: POST
URL: (AirTable Data: GoPhish Server URL)api/templates/    # Important note here: if you forget or add an extra /, it will mess up the entire request.
Data Pass-Through: False
Data: (ChatGPT "Email Body" Reply)    # We deleted this step for demonstration purposes
Unflatten: No
Basic Auth: (empty)
Headers:

1) 
    Authorization
        Bearer <GoPhish API Key>
2)
    Content-Type
        application/json

Once these variables are set, we can send a request to our GoPhish server via it's public IPv4 address to port 3333. It will include a header with the API key for authentication.

If you receive any errors with this, check the following:

When passing along the GoPhish server link, pay attention to slashes ( / ) and make sure they follow proper formatting, like so: https://1.1.1.1/api/templates/

If you receive a successful response, the data will be returned in Zapier, and you will see the Template populate in GoPhish.

From here, you repeat the process for Groups and Campaigns. You can utilize ChatGPT for the entire process.

What Now?
